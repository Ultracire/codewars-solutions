This repo contains the daily coding problems I complete on codewars.com.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Codewars allows me to work on challenging coding problems and apply my DSA knowledge!

## Optimizations

After submitting a solution, I analyze it and look to the community for suggestions. I continually try to tinker my code to make it more efficient and readable. 

## Lessons Learned:

From doing these challenges, I have learned to be consistent and persistent: if the first solution does not work, I iterate through other options, and try to look at the problem from different angles. I learned that I have a long way ahead to my desired mastery of JS and DSA, but I will keep putting in the effort every day to achieve my coding goals.
